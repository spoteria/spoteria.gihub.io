        Hello again, this is our third blog post. There have been quite a few development for our electrical system, and software aspect as well. 
            </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        <b>Electrical:</b> There were quite some significant developments for the electrical aspect of the project. The actuator was interfaced with an Arduino Uno and was able to be controlled. The major problem observed was that the speed of actuation was quite slow, taking almost two whole minutes for the maximum 18 inch actuation in one direction. This was mainly due to the lower 2A current we were supplying primarily to safely test the electrical system, but this will be changed to a 3A power supply in the future.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        The next step involved integration with the mechanical system, where the functioning actuator was attached to the tv stand. The initial trials have gone well, where the actuator is able to support the weight of the entire system and move to the maximum and minimum actuation heights. Similar to above, the speed was noted to be quite slow, but increasing the current of the power supply to 3A should resolve this issue.      
      </p>
     
      <p class="mb-3">
        <b>Software:</b> The visual interface has been primarily developed in Unity, with most of the machine learning development taking place using TuriCreate. However, we are facing challenges interfacing between these different platforms, where the functionality of the Kinect sensor becomes limited depending on the configuration. This is the critical piece in our project and the main focus of our attention right now. As of now we are exploring alternative approaches to remedy this problem.
      </p>
      
      <p class="mb-3">
        <b>Next Steps:</b> Next steps for the electrical aspect involve interfacing the Arduino code with the user recognition code involving the Kinect, so the actuator can adjust the display to the correct height. Additionally, the actuator needs to be characterized to be able to move the display to a desired height, and to support this we also need to develop the PD controller.
        For the software aspect, the focus is to integrate the machine learning approach with the user interface, and this is currently our main priority with alternative approaches being explored.

        Hello, this is our second blog post. There have been some significant updates in terms of the development of the mechanical design.  
            </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        <b>Mechanical:</b> In terms of the mechanical aspect of this project there have been some major design revisions to improve the project. Firstly, the portion of the frame that holds up the TV was reduced in size. This was to improve the practicality of the interfacing of the actuator such that the minimum height of the TV would be suitable for someone performing seated exercises, and the actuator could adjust the height of the TV with an increase of up to 18 inches in height. Additionally, the reduction in the mounting height of the TV was more suitable for the stability of the overall frame, otherwise having the TV mounted too high posed the risk for causing a moment which could have led to instability. 
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        Additionally, the base component of the mechanical system was reduced in length. The original design had left some extra tolerance, but this was determined to be unnecessary as reducing the length of the base component within a certain threshold did not impact stability. This also allows for easier transportation as the footprint of the mechanical system is reduced.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        The third major change to the mechanical design was the addition of two horizontal pieces meant to reinforce the stability during actuation. Initial trials with the actuator showed that the sliding legs for the TV mount had some wobble in them during actuation. This resulted in the TV being non-level. The problem was that the two legs were isolated from one another and needed to be connected to equalize their movements. We determined that this could be remedied by adding some supporting pieces connecting the moving legs, which would increase their stability and resolve the issue of the wobble.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        These were the major mechanical developments during the course of this week, and primarily involved increasing the stability of the mechanical design, while streamlining the design. For the time being the mechanical aspect has been completed.

      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">
        <b>Next Steps:</b> Now that the mechanical design has been completed our focus will be solely towards our electrical aspect and most importantly the software aspect of our project with a focus on implementing the actuator and the exercise recognition algorithms.

				Hello, this is our first blog post. Our website is now live, and we have quite a few updates to share with you since our last presentation in November. 
            </p>
			<p class="mb-3">
				But before that for those of you new to our project we’ll just break down what Spoteria is and what we aim to accomplish. Spoteria is designed to be a smart mirror display meant to improve your workouts. It is specifically targeted towards shoulders, as they are one of the common sources of injury during workouts for novices. Issues such as shoulder impingement (our main focus), and others can lead to limited range of movement for the shoulders and by extension for the whole arm. Given that shoulder exercises are a popular workout choice, we decided to focus on shoulder exercises only for the scope of this project. Following an iterative design procedure we explored different design approaches to combat this problem, such as wearable sensors and smart workout machines. However based on our project criteria and constraints we ultimately decided on a design involving a smart mirror display coupled with a Kinect sensor to track user exercise form, while providing them with real time visual feedback in the form of a smart mirror display.				
			</p>
			<p class="mb-3">
				Project development has been well under way and there have been quite a few developments for Spoteria over the course of the winter break. The developments can be broken down by their respective components.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-3">
				<b>Mechanical:</b> In terms of mechanical development preliminary design has been completed. From the design in Solidworks, to the mechanical analysis performed in ANSYS, the first physical mechanical prototype has been assembled. This is the first design prototype for the mechanical aspect of the project. For those not familiar the mechanical aspect of this project presents a TV stand type assembly which will be used to support the smart display and will work with the actuator to adjust the display height to match the user’s workout height. For next steps the mechanical assembly needs to be integrated with the linear actuator, for more details refer to the electrical section below.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-3">
				<b>Software:</b> For software development the proof of concept is complete. We are able to capture users through the Kinect sensor and able to identify major joints. Furthermore in the current implementation we have designed an algorithm to be able to track the user’s joint angles, which can then be used to critique their exercise form. However there is still quite a bit of software work required for the next steps in the project as the machine learning models for exercise identification need to be developed and trained so that the exercise performed by the user can be identified, a necessary step for form critiquing.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-3">
				<b>Electrical:</b> For electrical, all of the required components have been acquired, including the linear actuator. There is still quite a bit of development required on this front to test the actuator with the mechanical system, and ensure that it is functional with the TV mounted. The actuator needs to be interfaced with the user recognition software component, to be accomplished through an Arduino for the hardware side of things, so that the actuator can adjust the display height according to the height of the user. Additionally, we still need to finalize the circuit schematic for the actuator control circuit. Furthermore, CSA approval will be required for the electrical component as the actuator relies on a 12 V, 3A power supply, where the required current can be fatal if not handled correctly.
			</p>		
			<p class="mb-3">
				<b>Next Steps:</b> Some of the required next steps have already been mentioned above, but looking at our immediate agenda the two main priorities would be finalizing the electric system and integrating it with the mechanical prototype. And secondly, developing the models for exercise identification. This can be considered a critical piece of our design because if this fails there is no metric to critique exercise form if the system can’t identify what exercise the user is performing. These two tasks are our immediate priorities, which we aim to accomplish by the end of January. Given that these are accomplished our project would essentially fulfill its minimal level of viable operation.
